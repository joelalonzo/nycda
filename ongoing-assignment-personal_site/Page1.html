	<p>Out of the millions of sites out there on the interwebs, you just so happened to stumble onto mine... well how unlucky you are.  But since you're already here, you might as well know a little bit about me. My name is Joel Alonzo.  I was born in New York, and spent most of my childhood in Manhattan.  I "finished" growing up in North Jersey. I moved to Philadelphia last year beacuse I was in need of a change in scenery..Don't judge me, the NYC area isnt all <em>THAT</em> great.  I mean sure if you like paying through the nose for a shoebox sized apartment, feel free to move on up :)</p>

	<!--Talk about yourself -->
	<h2>So what do I do for work?</h2>

			<p>I am a Software QA Engineer, which means that my job is to make sure that developers aren't breaking things when we push out new updates. My day is certainly never boring!</p>
